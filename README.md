## Project 2 [Climate Change Analytics](https://github.com/mingcizzz/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/Proj_2%20%20Climate%20Change%20Analysis)

 This task involving roughly 100k observations of building energy usage records collected over 7 years and a number of states within the United States. The dataset consists of building characteristics, weather data for the location of the building  as well as the energy usage for the building and the given year, measured as Site Energy Usage Intensity. The goal of analysis is to predict the Site EUI, given the characteristics of the building and the weather data for the location of the building.
